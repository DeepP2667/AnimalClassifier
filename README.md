# AnimalClassification

Personal Project:
    Classify between dogs vs cats
    Have a GUI to input image to classify

Future Plans:
    Add different genuses such as tiger vs lion
    Hopefully combine differnt models to differentiate between different genuses
    Instead of a GUI, create an app that classifies the genus based on a picture you take
